### How To Build From Command Line
1. Create local.properties file and set sdk.dir property to location where you installed android SDK
    `sdk.dir=<path to android SDK>`
2. In project top directory execute following command

    ```bash
    ant debug
    ```
3. malarm-debug.apk will be created in bin directory, if successed

### Start Android Emulator And Install APK From Command Line
1. start android emulator

    ```bash
    emulator -avd <avdname>
    ```
2. install application on android emulator

    ```bash
    adb install bin/malarm-cmd.apk
    ```
(build.xml and *.property files are created by android create command)

### Automated UI Test
There is a GUI automated test using Robotium, named
[malarm_test](https://github.com/mamewotoko/malarm_test)

Memo
----
* URL list specification
    1. if malarm/urllist.txt exists in external storage(e.g. SD card), it is used as url list file
       url list file is a text file which contains title followed by tab and its url par line
       you can specify slide show contents in asset
       e.g. file:///android_asset/local/step.html
    2. otherwise, url list specified by UI is used
        pref_url_list_value in values/arrays.xml is used
* MultiListPreference is based on the following web page
http://blog.350nice.com/wp/archives/240
* Alarm application starts when user push appwidget of malarm.
* [Dropsync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) is a useful Android app!
* To use @Overrides annotation, use following eclipse setting 
`org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.compliance=1.6`
* Notification.setLatestEventInfo is removed.....
